# Mechanical-Ventilation-Duration-Prediction
This repository contains the code and data for a Final Year Project on predicting mechanical ventilation duration using deep learning models. The project explores the potential of using patient data to accurately predict the duration of mechanical ventilation, which can improve patient outcomes and resource utilization in critical care settings.
